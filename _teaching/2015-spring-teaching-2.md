A week-long embedded systems bootcamp for students aged 13--18, delivered with a
mix of talks, hands-on tutorials with Jupyter Notebooks, and specialised
breakout sessions. Topics included microprocessors, FPGAs, basic I/O, audio
processing, computer vision, robotics, and Python. The students then completed
their own hackathon projects on the theme of sustainability.

I wrote and hosted the day 1 material, getting the students started with their
devices and PYNQ platform, Python fundamentals, and using basic device I/O. I
also helped direct and edit the materials for the specialised breakout sessions.
All sessions were driven by _active learning_, where each student could
immediately apply new concepts with their own embedded device. Differentiated
learning also played an important role given the age range of the participants.
The group-based hackathon element encouraged collaborative learning, with
supervision only on request.

The success of this event resulted in the bootcamp becoming an annual event,
running on the same foundations for a further 4 years.

[This article](https://www.svvsd.org/2019/08/15/xilinx-turns-the-innovation-center-pynq-2/) offers some reflection from the attendees, including:

> For me one of the most interesting things was the session on computer vision
> because you can take a look at all of these different objects and you can get
> the computer to find out what it is – the programming that drives that is
> really interesting.
