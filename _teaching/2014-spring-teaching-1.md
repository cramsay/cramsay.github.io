An workshop designed to give developers rapid, hands-on experience with Xilinx's
RFSoC devices. These devices have a high barrier-to-entry since the developer
traditionally needs knowledge across many domains --- software for embedded
processors, hardware design, digital signal processing, and radio frequency
signals. This workshop massively lowers this barrier by offering a single
Python-based interface to control aspects of each domain.

Delivered (in-person and remotely) via a set of interactive designs and tutorial
materials that run _on the RFSoC device_ and are accessible as Jupyter Notebooks
via a web browser. The first in-person edition of this workshop enabled ~80
developers to enjoy hands-on experience with these complex devices over the
course of 2 days, as part of AMD/Xilinx's xSight conference.

I was, in part, responsible for writing the tutorial content, developing the
underlying PYNQ RFSoC platform, and hosting the first workshops.
