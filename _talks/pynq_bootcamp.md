A week-long embedded systems bootcamp for 8th--12th grade students, delivered
with a mix of talks, hands-on tutorials with Jupyter Notebooks, and specialised
breakout sessions. Topics included microprocessors, FPGAs, basic I/O, audio
processing, computer vision, robotics, and Python. The students then completed
their own hackathon projects on the theme of sustainability. One system was an
autonomous janitor that used computer vision techniques to identify trash and
clean it up!
