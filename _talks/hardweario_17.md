Side-channel attacks can recover secret keys from cryptographic algorithms
(including the pervasive AES) using measurements such as power use. However,
these previously-known attacks on AES tend to require unrestricted, physical
access to the device. Using improved antenna and signal processing, Fox-IT and
Riscure show how to covertly recover the encryption key from two realistic
AES-256 implementations while:

  1. Attacking at a distance of up to 1 m (30 cm in realistic conditions; "TEMPEST"),
  2. Using minimal equipment (fits in a jacket pocket, costs less than ‚Ç¨200) and
  3. Needing only a few minutes (5 minutes for 1 m and 50 seconds for 30 cm.) To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first public demonstration of such covert
attacks from a distance.
