HAFLANG presentation at the 20th anniversary edition of SPLS.

> Custom hardware architectures for functional languages enjoyed a boom in the
> 80s and 90s following Backus' Turing Award lecture "Can Programming Be
> Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A Functional Style and Its Algebra of
> Programs". Research interest later waned due to difficulties in matching the
> rapid pace of RISC processor development and compiler techniques.
>
> This talk from the HAFLANG project re-explores these ideas in a modern
> landscape --- where single-thread performance of stock CPUs have begun to
> stagnate, but the performance of hardware prototyping platforms such as FPGAs
> have not. We present the Heron processor for evaluating non-strict functional
> programs, as well as its concurrent hardware garbage collector. While still
> slightly slower than conventional platforms, it offers interesting advantages
> in energy efficiency and opportunity for formal verification from source
> language down to hardware implementation. We also propose a path towards a
> single-chip many-core architecture.
