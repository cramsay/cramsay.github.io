I'm Craig, and I spend some of my time as a research associate at Heriot-Watt
University.

My most recent research project is all about (timely) leveraging of custom
hardware architectures to help accelerate lazy, functional programming
languages, such as Haskell.

I've been working on the [HAFLANG project](https://haflang.github.io/) for the
past few years, and maintain a healthy interest in the design of functional
hardware description languages, among other things, but this site is mostly for
professional use. Check out some of my [publications](/publications), [talks](/talks), and [teaching experience](/teaching) here.
