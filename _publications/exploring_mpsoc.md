An academic book written in partnership with AMD/Xilinx. With the goal of making complex, heterogeneous system-on-chip systems more accessible, it has enjoyed wide impact:

  * Over 35k [downloads](https://www.zynq-mpsoc-book.com/)
  * Gaining at least [53 academic
    citations](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=13542466655873698020&as_sdt=5,39&sciodt=7,39&hl=nl),
    and
  * Use as course material for more than 5 external university courses,
    including [Rice University](https://www.clear.rice.edu/elec522/), [Trinity
    College
    Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/media/tcd/engineering/pdfs/current-students/EEU44C01---Integrated-Systems-Design-24.25.pdf),
    [LinkÃ¶ping
    University](file:///home/craig/Downloads/Course%20literature%20TSEA85.pdf).


I was responsible for
writing over 130 pages on topics including:

  + Processor architecture for real-time applications (enabling robotics,
    automotive, and safety-critical applications)
  + System security, including information assurance, anti-tampering, and isolation techniques
  + Software stacks, ranging from bare-metal and FreeRTOS to full Linux platforms
  + Heterogeneous multiprocessor development, covering symmetric multiprocessing
    (on Linux), asymmetric multiprocessing (with OpenAMP and the Xen
    hypervisors)
  + System booting, including secure boot topics, cryptography, and practical
    examples

> This book introduces the Zynq MPSoC (Multi-Processor System-on-Chip), an
> embedded device from Xilinx that combines a processing system that includes
> Arm Cortex-A53 application and Arm Cortex-R5 real-time processors, alongside
> FPGA programmable logic. The book covers the architecture of the device, the
> design tools and methods, conventional hardware/software co-design approach,
> and the newer software-defined methodology, as well as hardware and software
> development, multiprocessing, safety, security and platform management, system
> booting, and special features on PYNQ (a Python-based framework) and machine
> learning applications. This book should serve as a useful guide for those
> getting starting with, and the working with Zynq MPSoC, and equally as a
> reference for technical managers wishing to gain familiarity with the device
> and its associated design methodologies.
