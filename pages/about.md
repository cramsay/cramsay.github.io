# About

I'm craig. For work, I do research around hardware design, functional programming, and verification. I've recently been working on the [HAFLANG project](/haflang/), making custom computer architectures for lazy functional languages. I previously explored functional hardware description languages (including my own [one with dependent types](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/toatie-functional-hardware-description-with-dependent-types)) as a means of designing circuits for software defined radio applications with [a Strathclyde research group](https://sdr.eee.strath.ac.uk/).

These topics also lend themselves pretty well to academic shitposts around digital music and obsolete game consoles... some of which might appear here soon.
