# HAFLANG

I've been working on the HAFLANG project at Heriot-Watt university for a few
years. Project homepage is [here](https://haflang.github.io/).

We're exploring custom hardware architectures to directly support lazy
functional programming languages, such as Haskell. It's good fun --- combining
some FPGA hacking, compiler design, and computer architecture.

## Papers

  + [Heron: Modern Hardware Graph
    Reduction](https://doi.org/10.1145/3652561.3652564) --- talks about a our
    graph reduction system using template instantiation
  + [Cloaca: A Concurrent Hardware Garbage Collector for Non-strict Functional
    Languages](https://doi.org/10.1145/3677999.3678277) --- talks about our
    concurrent hardware garbage collector

## Talks

  + [Haskell '24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFqMpfb8Cyk) --- talks about our garbage collector architecture
  + [HAFDAL '24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC7z-6LLzUk&pp=ygUUaGFmbGFuZyBjcmFpZyByYW1zYXk%3D) --- an overview of our reduction core and some WIP garbage collection
  + [HAFDAL '24 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=476dsOEJD0g&list=PL7l6O156PEicRgKO98QGvbs0WpTsCQIon) --- a playlist of _all_ the invited talks for our hardware acceleration for declarative languages workshop
  + [LAIV '23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtWJ_5qNqdE&pp=ygUUaGFmbGFuZyBjcmFpZyByYW1zYXk%3D) --- a seminar for Heriot-Watt's "Lab for AI Verification"/"Dependable System Group" on early work
